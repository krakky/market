# Coopr Standalone | v 1.0
Coopr is used internally as a self-service cluster provisioner for our developers, as a CI tool for integration testing, and as a DevOps tool to test new and incremental features. We’ve been developing and using Coopr for over a year, and we’re noticing the benefits: our developer and DevOps productivity have doubled, and our development and test cycles have become faster.
