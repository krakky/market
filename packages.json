Apache Spark has an advanced DAG execution engine that supports acyclic data flow and in-memory computing. Spark offers over 80 high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel apps. And you can use it interactively from the Scala, Python and R shells. Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX, and Spark Streaming. You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application. Spark runs on Hadoop, Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources including HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, and S3. Supported OS: CentOS 6, CentOS 7, Ubuntu 14(trusty) & Ubuntu 16 (xenial) !"
